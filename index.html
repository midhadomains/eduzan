    <h2 style='text-decoration: underline;'>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The objective of this article is to get an understanding of R&sup2; and what is the optimum value for this
        parameter in interpreting results. <br /><b>'Is there any specific range for R&sup2; that can be said to be
            optimum?' and 'Does a High R&sup2; value an indicator of a better model relative to Low R&sup2;?'</b>, We
        will discuss these queries and analyse them to get a suitable conclusion.</p>
    <h2 style='text-decoration: underline;'>R&sup2; Meaning & Interpretation</h2>
    <p>The R&sup2; can be interpreted as 'the percentage of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by
        independent variable collectively'. In simple terms, it can be expressed as 'Out of total variance in the
        dependent variable the proportion that is explained by the Independent variable' <b>*[Explained variance/Total
            variance]</b></p>
    <h2 style='text-decoration: underline;'>R&sup2; Value -A Beautiful illusion</h2>
    <p>As you got the idea of the R&sup2;, you start correlating the efficiency of the model to the higher value of
        R&sup2;. In short, the higher the R&sup2; the more efficient the model is and the highest R&sup2; possible
        should be relatively the best model as it explains most of the variance in the dependent variable. <br />This is
        not so simple in reality, and just the high value of <b>the R&sup2; does not justify the efficiency of the
            model</b>. The assumption is completely flawed and there can be various issues with the higher value of the
        R&sup2;. The R&sup2; is not sufficient in itself to claim the superiority of the Regression model and we need
        other technical reports attached to the R&sup2; report to gain insight. <br />Similarly, a <b>Low R&sup2; can be
            a good model</b>, as some fields of study have an <b>inherently great amount of unexplainable variance</b>.
        In these areas, the values of R&sup2; are bound to be lower. For example, Studies that try to explain Human
        Psychology generally have a Low R&sup2; value. This is in agreement with the fact that <b>the human mind is
            difficult to predict in contrast to the physical process</b>. But even in such a case wherein the model has
        a low R&sup2; value but the independent variables are statistically significant, you can still make conclusions
        based upon the relationship between variables and it is vital wherein innovation and unexplainable phenomena are
        being tried to explain in context to any subject area. Thus, a high R&sup2; not always implies a good model and
        vice versa. <br /><span style='font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;'>Few citations that report a low
            coefficient of determination (R-squared) in a study of human psychology:</span>

                accurately]</span>
        </li>
    </ol> <span style='color: rgb(6, 6, 60);'>[Important Note: There are some scenarios where low R2 can cause problems
        such as where a great deal of precision is required, for e.g.- Elon musk space company SpaceX analysing the
        relationship between 'atmospheric drag' and 'time taken' to execute the placement aspects. For placement in the
        orbit, The R2 should be sufficiently high, backed up with great technical aspects(Random residual pattern around
        '0' residual value) as precision is of utmost importance.]</span></p>
    <h2>Residual Pattern Analysis <span> - Insight on exposure to specification bias (Needs to be Attached with
            R-squared report)</span></h2><br>A residual plot analysis will give a better insight to fetch more technical
    aspects of the model. As mentioned earlier that alone R&sup2; fails to give any insight regarding the model. For
    better insight, we will do a <b>'residual-plot analysis'</b> and <b>'study the pattern of the residuals'</b>.
    <br />To do such an analysis we take two axis 'x' and 'y', On the x-axis we will take the independent variable,
    (predicted values) and, on the y-axis, we will take the residual values. Just to make things clearer, <br /><span

        Å·</span>The residual plot gives a visual validation to the model under study by <b>observing the residual
        patterns along the '0' level mark of residual value.</b> If the scatter is random [no observed pattern] along
    the axis, we interpret this as a <span style='color: greenyellow;'> 'Green flag'</span> and good to go with an
    unbiased model. On the other side, if the scatter of residuals has a certain pattern this is a <span
        style='color: red;'> 'Red flag'</span>, and it should be meant <b>the model is not the right fit or is a bad fit
        despite a high R&sup2;.</b> <br />The red flag raised gives an insight that the model has an issue. In other
    words, it is missing significant independent variables or/and polynomial terms or/and interaction terms. ['or' &
    'and' can have any permutation and combination] <br /><b>[Note: An unbiased model has residuals that are randomly
        scattered]</b> <br /><br></br><img

    <h2 style='text-decoration: underline;'>Conclusion - A Holistic approach</h2>
    <p>The approach of asking the question 'What is a good R&sup2; value' is an ignorance of 'permutation & combination
        of factors linked to the Model'. The R&sup2; is not sufficient to answer the model validity. When combined with
        Technical & Subjective parameters it conveys a better validity. <br />In essence, the holistic approach gives
        confidence in the model's reliability. <b> There is no such pre-defined R2 value that is optimum or crossing a
            threshold R2 the model becomes efficient, rather it depends on technical aspects attached as we discussed
            the Model validity [Residual plot analysis] and subjective criteria such as Field of study 'the inherent
            nature' of the variable under study and maybe some other parameter too [like anticipated precision
            level].</b> <br />Thus, a holistic view gives a better perspective on the Regression Model rather than just
        the value of R&sup2; which is incomplete to make any judgement on the quality of model. So, we can conclude that
        there is no such R&sup2; value that is good but a holistic view that is required for a model to be analysed.
